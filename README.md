# BEExact: a high-resolution database for taxonomic inference of honey bee-associated microbial communities

## Description
BEExact is a comprehensive, non-redudant, reference database that has been thoroughly curated for use with 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing of the honey bee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) microbiota. Recent reports have pronounced the need to move beyond the long time standard of phylotype-level characterization of the honey bee microbiota (Ellegaard and Engel, 2019; Nature Communications). BEExact addresses this concern by allow species-level resolution of all core microbiota members as well as a number of other symbionts, pathobionts, and a wide variety of environmetnal taxa that, albeit being present at low levels, are commonly found transiently associated with honey bees. 

In the pending publication, BEExact is benchmarked at classifying ~90% honey bee-derived V4 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) at the species-level, which represents an approximate 6-fold improvement in comparison to the commonly used SILVA v138 database which is expected to classify ~14% of these habitat-specific ASVs. 

Following the peer-review process, a list of data-driven recommendations based off our findings will be provided on this homepage as a guide to help standardize the analysis of honey bee-associaed microbial communities in future studies.

## Available databases for download:

1. <b>BEEx-FL-refs</b> (the complete database containing near full length references for all known honey bee-specific 16S rRNA gene sequences)
2. <b>V4 region training set</b> (containing V4 reference sequences with primers trimmed) *** <i>Recommended for use with IDTAXA for best performance but performs well with Bayesian classifiers implemented in DADA2/QIIME2 pipelines as well </i> ***

All feedback welcomed. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. Sharing of information is also encouraged, especially for novel honey bee-associated species that have recently been discovered but not yet incorporated into the BEExact database. Teamwork makes the dreamwork.
