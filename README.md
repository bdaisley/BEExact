# BEExact: high-resolution taxonomic inference of honey bee-associated microbial communities

## Description
BEExact is a comprehensive, non-redudant, reference database that has been thoroughly curated for use with 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing of the honey bee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) microbiota. BEExact is benchmarked at classifying ~90% honey bee-derived V4 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) at the species level, representing an approximate 6-fold increase in comparison to the commonly used SILVA v138 database which is expected to classify ~14% of these habitat-specific ASVs. 

## Available databases for download:

1. <b>Complete database</b> (containing near full length references for all known honey bee-specific 16S rRNA gene sequences)
2. <b>V4 region training set</b> (containing V4 reference sequences with primers trimmed) *** <i>Recommended for use with IDTAXA for best performance but performs well with Bayesian classifiers implemented in DADA2/QIIME2 pipelines as well </i> ***
